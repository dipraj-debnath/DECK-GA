# DECK-GA A Hybrid KMeans Clustering and Genetic Algorithm for Optimised Mulit-UAV Path Planning in Multi-Traveling Salesman Problems
This repository presents DECK-GA, a hybrid algorithmic framework that combines DynamicCentroid Kmeans (DCKmeans) clustering with Distance Efficient Genetic Algorithm (DEGA) to solve path planning problems such as centroid instability, 
suboptimal UAV path distribution. This approach improves centroid initialisation and integration in DCKmeans to produce stable cluster formations. 
DEGA also improves trajectories  through a fitness-proportionate selection mechanism and an adaptive crossover mutation method, effectively increasing solution diversity and accelerating convergence.
